The Working Programmer's Guide To Working Programs

## Intro

We want to not abstract from system details but to represent them in a logic where we can reason about device drivers and memory layouts. We will scaffold our system in a way that it can be built on any computational substrate as a self describing operating system that provides facilities for extension.
